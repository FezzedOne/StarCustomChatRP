# StarCustomChat: Roleplay

This plugin for [StarCustomChat](https://github.com/KrashV/StarCustomChat) is dedicated to the roleplay aspects of the game. It consists of the following modules:

## Edit message
You can edit the message using the context menu. The changes will only be seen by the players on the same planet as you.

## Proximity chat
You can specify the stagehand that would receive the message and then resend it to people around, or you can skip the stagehand and send the message around your character.

*Obviously, only people with the mod installed will receive this message*

## OOC chat
A simple tab that automatically adds double brackets around your message (( )). Also places the OOC messages in a separate channel which you can turn off.

## RP Chat

This plugin brings an ability to color the \*Actions* and %Thoughts% within messsages into custom, user-specific colors.

Also, people with the Admin permissions can fire an Announcement message in your face, that will ignore all your filters and will have the scary red color.

*Now you can truly make an announcement about what exactly Shadow the Hedgehog did to your wife*

## RP Languages

> This requires Starbound server administrators to set up the language support on their side

> People without the mod will see the normal message - with some extra spaces in it - when you use this functionality.

You can specify the language your character will be speaking in "Quotation marks", so that the characters who don't know this language might find it hard to read.

### Stagehand example

#### editmessage.json.patch

Should be located at "/interface/scripted/starcustomchat/plugins/languages/languages.json.patch" and contain the following:

```diff
[
  { "op": "replace", "path": "/parameters/stagehandType", "value": "STAGEHAND_NAME"}
]
```

#### myserverchatstagehand.lua

The code is very similar to the description in [StarCustomChat](https://github.com/KrashV/StarCustomChat?tab=readme-ov-file#stagehand-configuration):

```lua
function init()
  local purpose = config.getParameter("message")
  local data = config.getParameter("data")
  if purpose == "retrieveLanguages" then
    sendToPlayer(data.playerId, root.assetJson("/your/path/to/the/languages/json/file"))
  end
end
```

The example of the json file is provided below:
```json
{
    "CoolServ_DR": {
      "name": "Draconic",
      "difficulty": 3,
      "description": "Language of dragons, kobolds and other liz-zards"
    },
    "CoolServ_EL": {
      "name": "Elvish"
    },
    "CoolServ_AF": {
      "name": "Infernal",
      "difficulty": 10,
      "specialCharacters": ["ç", "ñ", "ß", "ø", "å", "æ", "œ", "ý", "ÿ"]
    },
    "CoolServ_CO": {
      "name": "Common",
      "difficulty": 0
    }
}
```

* **Name** [Mandatory] - The name of the language displayed to the user.
* **Description** [Optional] - A description of the language that appears on the settings tab.
* **Difficulty** [Optional] - The number of increments of "learning" (*pressing the "up" button on the knowledge spinner*) required to learn the language. If omitted, the default value is `1`. A value of `0` means the language is known to everyone and does not require learning.
